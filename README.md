# Microservice Rate Limiter

This i a microservice in .NET Core (C#) that acts as a rate limiter. It enforces limits per-account and per-phone number.

It automatically clears data for accounts and phone numbers that have not been used for a period of 1 hour.

(If anything is wonky it's probably because I deleted the entire codebase and restored it from dangling git blobs.)
